    Let's do a little fuckery. Wherever your are, next time you are outside ask for a monetary coin. Once you get that coin, ask for explaination from the lender as to why they budged. If it satisfies your reasoning, give it back. If not, keep the coin. I am teaching you how to fuck money, so tread with brains [and only ask me questions]. Do you know that scene in Mr. Robot where money is set to fire. Yeah, fsociety. But no seriously, let's barter again and this time under the laws of ethics [ethos]. You give me a nuke, i give you a nuke. you give me a candy, i give you insulin. you give me your trust, i promise to die when i catch myself exploiting it. Escalated quickly there.
    I am learning how to take interest in observing/ understanding charts. I hate 'em. I only like functions that too mostly linear. When was the last time you googled "Atomic clock"? I never googled it. I heard it in some NASA docuentry, or perhaps in a school book. I do not remeber the source of this information. I'm sorry. What are emotions made of? chemical imbalance? electrical impulse? physical reality? Mine are made up [of].
    When i was in the hospital after i tried to kms, I meet this person, we shared the same room there. He taught me about lycopene, he was a walking encyclopedia. We had so much fun just asking questions, analyzing answer for clarity and be judged for being there. Hospitals are no fun like that, especially when you could make your doctor well up. I swear he must've called me a dementor.. only thing we have in common is I am brown. But I do sometimes feel like my melancholy drives the happiness around me distant. It's like I get in control of the room's vibe. And my vibe takes over. Difficult to explain, but laughter fixes it. * knock, knock *
