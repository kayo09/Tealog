I'm in your arms
..
    I am overestimating some of my abilities. Grateful that I am in India where getting humbled by life is a daily occurance. But, some things that my fellow Indians do, drive me up a wall. I wish someone could embedd that one quote from chenuxyz that goes something like make easy things easy and hard things possible (sorry i know i butchered da quote). Well *sigh*. My mum made me some food, do you want the recipie or do you want me to come cook it for you? one sec let me eat first and I'll share after (mum wants me to eat it while its still warm, o mum). ok im back: 
    I ate soya chunks and rectangle cut potato (aka Q16587531). Mum made it and imma charge you one iphone for her reciepe.. No I am not doing that [yet]. So do you really wanna know the recipe? make some noise!!!
    Recipie: 
    - get soya chunks (for protein. the amount of estrogen in it is not gonna do anything noticible, I'm not a doctor)
    - Boil soya chunks and potatoes (for carbs aka energy) 
    - cut/ dice onions (anti-oxidants)
    - put it all in one pan or two pans if chore-meditation is your thing
    - cook (with a fan near you)
   The freemium version of this recipie is brought to you by kayparmar[dot][com]. Paid version will be available after i die lol. No but seriously cooking is easy. Try it. Or just pay UBEREATS! SKIPTHEDISHES! and someone's mom.
