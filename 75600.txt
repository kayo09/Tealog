Nothing compares to you
..
    No more quotes. day by day I am purging the things I love; to watch it reincarante in other ways. You know I grew up melancholic and still live that way. Only way I know. I hurt and hurt in that same capacity. You will love me regardless, eh? the world is so divided. it doesn't feel like it is for good. it feels like it is something to do with preservation of certain hierarchy. Maybe I am just looking at it wrong. CVE aka see we eat. 
    Hungry people will eat almost anything. Almost. I mean that there are starving people who will not eat themselves and rather die.I am stubborn like that too. Momentary salvation don't interest me. People will not forget experiences. History might. But fuck history, it is written by cowards anyway. You might get in those books for 2, 20, 2000, 200000, 2000000, 2000000000 something years, but what after that? you too shall perish like I. I write that in your history. In our history. Feel the time pass. How do you feel it pass? I, through my breaths. My heart-beats. But mostly my breaths. That is my internal clock. Your's is should not be that far off either. Maybe it is metric-ized using hearty laughs? I hope so.
