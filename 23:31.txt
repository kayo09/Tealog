HELLO WORLD
------------------------------------------
growing old is so fun! and reverse psychology is only conditioning. Well, mostly all psychology is condtioning. I say mostly cause I do not know. I do not know because i do not google it.
"There is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow" said the Leprechaun, and i believed it until i saw it for myself that there was indeed no pot of gold nor an end to a rainbow. Life is oh so intense. A force of nature indeed.

    Growing up in these past few days was difficult. Initially i was growing inwards, almost felt like a big cell with no direction [motivation]. But felt like a big cell nonetheless.
Do things with pride, kay. no matter how difficult it gets. Do not lose that sense of pride, pride of being able to do.Do anything. Pride is recursion. and just like all recursion, it will use bandwith so imma have to be mindful and not let it keep building due to some dumb/ stupid condition.

    I was thinking about future. Well I am lying, somewhat. I wasn't thinking about my future. I was just thinking about future, as if I wasn't a part of it. It looked grim. Still does; and it scares the living fuck out of me. But I will focus on the bright side as I acknowledge the dark. There is always light. Nothing can escape it.
    I will end my rambling here. I need to priortize: 1. my health 2. health of people around me 3. the internet
