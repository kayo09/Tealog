this battle in my head
..
    Listening to Aaron Lewis covering Layne Stanley (did i mispell) was random for today. I miss Lanye. although i would not remember his name if you asked me. God bless you for nutshell. 
    all the songs in my head have slowly becoming earworms -> skeletons [lol]. I am giving most of my time to envisioning a lesser grim reality. is that possible? I'm trying. I need to manifest more, you call it wishful thinking? yeah then I've been doing it this whole time ig. 

    Why did China come with something like cov-19 and not something less like free-Alzheimer's for us all...
