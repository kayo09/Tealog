Bent String

    The guitar fret board is made to respect the fact that as you go from one fret to another, a semi-tone changes. This is irrecpective of your guitar tuning. Drop D, takes this concept to another level. I wonder if Kurt knew this. I know he felt it.
    The drums only have percussion. No fucks given to tunes. Bang bang bitch. But they are far more difficult to control since you can only get so close to being a metronome. And well, playing when the bar starts off with a reset so that you're off beat, do you know how hard it is to train for this? just to have it mean nothing. Why? for the sake of it ig. Then you have the different pressures your sticks can apply. I would say treble cleft is like raising a daughter and bass cleft is like raising a boy. Both need thorough consideration before being played with.

    Ambiguity only arises when you overthink. Do what you will with that info. Anyway, I need to understand why I am so scared helpless. What is driving this mania? and what I must do to have it not outlive me. I am sorry Stallman has cancer. I am grateful it's in remission. I was probably in 7th grade when I first heard "lymphosarcoma of the intestine", the protagonist in the movie had it. One of the songs from that movies used to be my lullabies for a long time. The song was serene. Is serene.

    Something about Reggae music just makes my body move. I like it. My shoulders moving back and forth, waving, floating, head bopping side to side, like I must emulate like this to soak it in.

    Do I make sense? Why don't you talk to me? Does my loneliness scare you? Do you think I will break you too? Good. Stay away, I am not made to make [liar].
