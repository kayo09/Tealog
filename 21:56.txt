    I hope you're not reading this too closely. What is randomness? someone needs to tell me this before i kms. "you know how to calm me down" with a ripple of piano and edm, isn't life great? It is. But we will decide for ourselves. Tinydesk fred is <3.

    Enough with the songs now. What is the purpose? to reach people. After god created Adam and after Adam created Eve from his rib, I wonder if he was just lonely or actually wanted to be God. "To be, or not to be" and "there is no good or bad only thinking makes it so" are two quotes surfacing in my psyche, conditioning at its finest lol. Making git is tuff, because i don't know if why I am wanting to make it. Is it gonna save lives? maybe. Is it gonna help some kid get beat for not knowing the basic commands? maybe. Why is that cycle necessary? maybe some king knows. My dearest no oppsec [a friend] is so brilliant that when people worry about him, they gaslight him into thinking he is schizo. I hope he makes it out okay. I hope i make it out ok. 
    I grew up in joint family [redacted] I am growing up in a big family. The dynamics are weird and I have to fix generational trauma, including a few of my own. However, i am dying. Just like how "rust" is actually metal burning but it is happening so slow we call it rust. Humans and our namesakes.
