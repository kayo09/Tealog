Seed Value
------------------------------------------

    Long day. I am out of energy. Most of the day was spent taking care of those 3 priorities. Albeit, I do not feel like I am making an impact. 
    I finally stopped taking my meds, I suffer from MDD and got prescribed a couple of benzos and a sedative cause doctors will play god if given a chance. I will play God now. "I am the captain now"; I am making a better git, ambitious? I know but it ain't that difficult if Mr. Linus could do it, so can anyone...

    The world still appears grim, but colorful. It's like observing grim repearspsyche after he droppped acid. I don't believe in all of that shit though, I lack belief in good. Do you? 

    Only the word "oxymoron" does my thoughts justice.
    I was going to start adding a list of my browser history from today just to maybe hold myself accountable and be slightly more productive. "consume less than you produce" said hotz, and it made its way to my head like an earworm, just likea lot of things he says, he knows he's provocative and good.. Or so I assume.

    If you're reading this, it's ok. I'm ok.
	"tough times create hard men,
	 hard men create soft times,
	 soft times create weak men
	 weak men create hard times"
	"When the going gets tough the tough gets going"
    This is my fuel. I want to plant trees whose shade I will never get to sit under.
    To getting better :*
