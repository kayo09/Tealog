    I am getting to teach speaking english to kids. ofc not paid (other than their smiles). The way I never got to learn since I never got to teach. I am grateful for that. I love teaching, always did and always tried to partake as I can. However, I would like to learn as well. I am not doing nearly enough. I am not reading books fast enough and I only say that cause I want to read so much!!!
