CARRY ON CARRY ON
..
    After all they are mine. This flame i wick with the pinch of my fingers, the blisters burn, i do not learn.     
    I need to not forget to take daily dose of "Whose Line is it Anyway?" [following naming convetion this once]
    I blame how i wrote yesterday to my decisive stand on not taking anymore antidepressents aka benzos aka cyclic chemicals lol. I hope you take this out of context. 

    What did is the first thing i could recall learning? for some reason spontaneous memory of fall off my tricycle learning to do wheelie and slamming my head in the Verandah, came to my mind. I was scared to do it again, but i did it anyway and sometimes i did not fall as the training wheels slowly came off. I am going trekking/ hiking soon. I hope to meet good people. It will be compeltely impromptu and fun!!!
