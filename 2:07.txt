Kyu aka Q aka Why

    As we grow older. We hack stronger. Say it with me. As we grow older (not us); grow older people. Water them, maybe help them die better. You define better. Not me, [im just a lowly scum]. Making hydra would've been so difficult, but an absolute fuck-you to society since you can't create a hydra. Prove me wrong, i am waiting. You can't though, you're not them/ him/ her. You're just well over 172 billion brain cells and the good part it you're constantly doing an "apt" update "apt" upgrade. do you know about foo or bar. I hope the end is worth it. Fictious Grim repear angle similing from heavens pearly gate as 1000 in 1 die. No one can kill you, if you do not want to. I mean yes there are scums who will kill, lie, lie, lie, sell your organs and do other horrendus stuff. But they did it anyway while you were alive. You're a statistic for them. Debate me if that's neccessary evil. God.
    anyway, let's hack cobblestone.htb. i'm trying ssh as mc. the router also has a 22, and subdomain "vote" is visible. My hydra thread is running, and I am seriously in awe. Do you even know how much effort goes into bruteforcing and not end the connection while doing so? yeah did you hack insta's in 2007? i didn't then.
    |spoiler-alert| the q-computers are susceptible to noise, it's almost like they just don't want to be manifested cause they know what it'll create |spoiler-end| you are also susceptible to noise. You're a quantum being too. So when you make your quantum computer, remeber to not freeze yourself. Wear proper protection equipments. Understand how it might manipulate you too or vice-versa.
