Teri Ankhein

    My eyes capture a few fleeting moments and cling on it with tears, they fall as i try to let them not leave me. Hey! can you smile for me please?
    Sometimes I feel like writing you my feelings... fleeting, i hold on it for you and they are so grand you must love it but i do not know you enough to fool you.
    
    Latin is medicines core, i found this sweet article (https://latinitium.com/the-ancient-language-of-learning-and-science/). I hope you read it, I only read a little at the hospital to have it in my bookmarks. Why? if you're asking me this, then I'll slowly stop asking it myself. No, not just yet.

    What grounds me these days: working on game, us, running, thinking about myself on earth, Whose line is it anyways, sleep, food, internet. I wish i could sing you an un-original song when you can't sleep.

    I must not tell you what I do not write [Promise me, you would not ever ask].. For i am an open-book. So difficult to think, speak, not lie, but lie to not hurt, think, do, !cry when cutting onions, cry, laugh, live. *smile*
